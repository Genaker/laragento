# Laragento

A collection of Model classes that allows you to get data directly from a Magento 2 database.

laragento is a collection of PHP classes built on top of Eloquent ORM (from Laravel framework), that provides a fluent interface to connect and get data directly from a Magento database.

You can use legacy MAgento 2 as the backend (administration panel), and any other PHP app in the other side querying those data (as a Model layer). It's easier to use Laragento with Laravel, but you're free to use it with any PHP project that uses Composer.
